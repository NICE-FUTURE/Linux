    In this directionary, I learnt how to type my first code in linux. And I print "Hello World !!!"successfully. (helloworld.c)  Otherwise I also learnt how to open and edit two file at the same window. (tryTwoVim.c) Then I learnt to use the "make" commend. (Makefile) 

Pay attention: 
    1.Whenever you want or need to input some number, espeicially your password. Don't use the number keyboard!!! Beacause you will often forget that it is loked!!!
    2.If you want to use the "make" commend, please enter "make", not "make [filename]".
    3.It still remains a problem. Just as you can see, every letter 'o' was in an orange background. I don't know how to getover it now. But I will try to getover it today.
    I find the ANSWER: Just in vim, the commend is ":nohighlight" or ":nohl".
